## Password Generation

- **Pronounceable passwords:** Generating passwords that are easier to remember and type
- **Exclusion lists:** Ability to exclude specific words, names, or patterns from the generated passwords to avoid predictable combinations
- **Bulk generation:** The ability to generate multiple passwords at once, which is helpful when managing multiple accounts
- **Local generation:** The option to generate passwords locally on the user's device without sending any data to external servers, ensuring greater security and privacy
- **Accessibility:** Support for various languages and special characters to accommodate international users
- **Password strength indicator:** Real-time feedback on the strength of the generated password to help users make informed decisions
